  - title: "The Web at 25: Lessons Learned, Forgotten, and Rediscovered"
    type: visiting
    speaker: Kimberly Blessing
    description: "In March 1989, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a “vague, but exciting” proposal for a hypertext-based information management system. That proposal eventually became the World Wide Web, a system that rapidly outgrew the competition, moved beyond the altruistic goals of its creator, and today dominates the Internet. Kimberly Blessing, a twenty-year veteran of the Web, will put lessons learned during those early days into a modern context for the next generation of web designers and developers."
