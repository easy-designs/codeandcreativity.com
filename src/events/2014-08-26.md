  - title: "Lessons Learned Working Apart: Thoughts on Distributed Collaboration and Remote Teams"
    type: visiting
    speaker: Kevin Hoffman
    description: "I've spent most of my career as part of a team working in an office, making the web a little better each day. When starting my own company, however, one of my goals was to find ways to work with the people I looked up to… who had their own separate offices in different companies spread out all over the world. In order to get started, I had to think differently about a lot of things: my day, my network, my goals, and how I communicate. I've found that working together across the internets has a lot more to do with the ability to share a vision, and a lot less to do with which is the best digital video conference service."
