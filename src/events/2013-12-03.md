    bio: "Nate Hill is an Assistant Director at the [Chattanooga Public Library](http://chattlibrary.org/), where he launched [The 4th Floor project](http://chattlibrary.org/4th-floor). The 4th Floor is a 14,000 square foot flexible community library space: some days it is a makerspace/hackerspace, others it serves as an event, production, and presentation space. In addition to his work in Chattanooga, Nate serves as a co-chair of the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/wiki/Main_Page)’s Marketing and Outreach Committee, and he’s been recognized by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation as an American representative for the International Network of Emerging Library Innovators (INELI) program. Nate was also named a “Mover and Shaker” by <cite>Library Journal</cite> in 2012. If Nate isn’t thinking about libraries, he’s thinking about design, nature, hiking, camping, or more importantly his fantastic wife, son, daughter, dog, and cat."
