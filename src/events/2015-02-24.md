  - title: "The Object Orientation of Teams: How the Nature of Code Makes Us Work Differently"
    type: visiting
    speaker: Lisa Welchman
    description: "We all know how technologies like the telegraph, the telephone, and the printing press impacted the way we work together and how we share information. But how does the nature of the way we code impact the way we work and live?  Do the dynamics of information flow and data structures dictate the dynamics of the teams that manage it or is it just a loose association?   Lisa will explore different types of collaborative team structures and theorize about how the nature of code and content we use to create our online world change the way organizations at large must work."

  - title: Designing for Gendered Audiences
    type: local
    speaker: Jessica Ivins
    description: "<cite>Time</cite> magazine recently proclaimed that the transgender movement is “the next civil rights frontier.” Are you unsure of what it means to be transgender? You’re not alone.\r\n\r\nEveryone has a gender identity. Gender influences our customers’ behaviors. It influences the way our customers present themselves to the world. We’re making design decisions for customers whose gender identity affects their lives, both offline and online.\r\n\r\nDesigners have struggled to understand the intersection of gender and design for decades. We often overlook gender or take it for granted. Sometimes we resort to assumptions like _women like pink stuff_ and _men like football_, but these assumptions rarely help us make an authentic connection with our audience.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a new civil rights movement is disrupting the notion of gender identity. As designers, what do we need to understand about gender identity? How do we design experiences that are inclusive for everyone?\r\n\r\nThe answer, as any UX designer will tell you, is _it depends_. Gender’s role in the design process varies from project to project. We’ll explore gender identity, what we as designers need to know about gender identity, and why an understanding of gender identity will help us make effective designs even stronger."
