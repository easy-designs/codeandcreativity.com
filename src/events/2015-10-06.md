    type: visiting
    speaker: Natalie Downe
    description: "Natalie launched the first version of [Lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com/) with a co-founder and her husband Simon, while on honeymoon in Casablanca. As the site took off, they realised their side project was destined to become something much bigger.\r\n\r\nThis talk will tell the story of Lanyrd from a two-week proof of concept to a fully-fledged startup, the lessons learned along the way about building and launching a product, running a company, raising investment and the entrepreneurship journey. This is the talk she wished she heard before getting started!"
