  - title: Everyday Storytelling
    type: visiting
    speaker: Steph Troeth
    description: "John LeCarre famously said, “‘The cat sat on the mat’ is not the beginning of a story; ‘the cat sat on the dog’s mat’ is.” We need very little introduction to the art of storytelling, but the craft of story is more nuanced and is a skill we can hone. Unless you’re already fully-engaged in storytelling in one form or another, it’s rare that we get to explore these nuances in practice. Come and have some fun with Steph in this interactive session as she demonstrates little ways we can get better at the craft of story—a universal skill that you can use in everything you do.\r\n\r\nThis talk covers some of the material from her forthcoming book: [<cite>UX Storytelling Handbook</cite>](http://bit.ly/uxstorytellinghandbook)."

  - title: Process, Tools & the Future of Our Practice
    type: local
    speaker: Justin Kropp
    description: "Tools are an essential part of our discipline. They afford us the opportunity to execute our work in the ways that we intended. However, the landscape of what is available to carry out our work has changed rapidly over the last decade—from the applications we use to strategize and design, to the frameworks and methodologies we use to build and deploy. These tools have not only influenced our processes, but also the way we approach our discipline. In this presentation, I'll explore the evolution of the design practice and the tools we use to craft our work."
