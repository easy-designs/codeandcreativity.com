  - title: Death to Bullshit
    type: visiting
    speaker: Brad Frost
    description: "More information exists now than ever before. 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Facebook users upload 350 million photos every day, and over 10% of all photos ever taken were taken just last year.\r\n\r\nAlong with the rise of all this information comes the amount of bullshit we're exposed to. We're all struggling to capture just a few precious seconds of people's attention, leading some creators to exploit dirty tricks and dark patterns to get things done.\r\n\r\nIt's our role as creators in this information-soaked age to create things that are genuinely valuable and respect people's time."

  - title: Coding for All
    type: local
    speaker: Jill Pala
    description: "There has been a lot of hype about Computer Science Education over the past year in both the local and national media. Is it warranted? Does everyone need to know how to code? (Disclaimer: Jill believes the answer to both is Yes!) In this talk she’ll explore some of the reasoning behind the push for CS Education, some creative ways CS Ed is being implemented around town, and how you can help the growing effort to bring Computer Science Education to all students."
