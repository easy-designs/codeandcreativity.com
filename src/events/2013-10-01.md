    description: "Remember how cool it was when you first learned how to tween objects in Flash? That’s how Jenn feels about using CSS transitions with hovers. In this talk, she’ll take a look at how adding CSS-enhanced hover states to designs can take your work to the next level and examine how these translate to touch devices. CSS transitions are all the rage these days and we’ll see how just the right amount of them can keep your aesthetic classy while adding some fun and interactive elements."
