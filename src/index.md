<h1 class="page-title">That’s all, folks!</h1>

Kelly & I ran the Code & Creativity talk series in Chattanooga, Tennessee from 2013-2015. We stopped running the events when we adopted our son Oscar and decided to focus on our family. It was an amazing event series though, which is why we’ve archived it for you here. There were some truly groundbreaking talks delivered at this event. We hope you’ll enjoy them as much as we did.
