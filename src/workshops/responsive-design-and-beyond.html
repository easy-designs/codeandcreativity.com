	<p>Responsive web design has taken our industry by storm and with good reason: it helps us improve our reach with less effort. But incorporating responsive design is not the goal, meeting our user’s needs is. Responsive design is not an end in itself… it’s just the beginning.</p>
	<p>As a fitting way to kick off our new workshop series, we’ve asked two internationally-renown mobile web and responsive design experts—<strong><a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/">Brad Frost</a></strong> (of <a href="http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/">This is Responsive</a>, and <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a> fame) and <strong><a href="http://blog.easy-designs.net/">Aaron Gustafson</a></strong> (author of <cite><a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/">Adaptive Web Design</a></cite>)—to come and teach us everything we need to know about working in this multi-device reality.</p>
	<p>For the first part of the day, Brad and Aaron will survey the landscape of responsive design, covering:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>broad concepts,</li>
		<li> strategies,</li>
		<li>the design process <span class="amp">&amp;</span> deliverables,</li>
		<li>emerging design patterns and principles, and</li>
		<li>development best practices and considerations.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Then, we’ll break into small groups to tackle some thorny responsive challenges through discussions, sketching, and maybe even a little coding while Brad <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Aaron provide real-time feedback and push us to go further. At the end, we’ll share our findings with the class and get additional feedback from the experts.</p>
	<p>Sounds like an awesome day, right? Sign up today! <strong>Space is strictly limited to 25 attendees.</strong></p>
